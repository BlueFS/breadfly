        totally enjoyed coding it-->




        <!--Why do I have to code the "Mobile responsiveness" part? 
            Hopefully it's easy.
        
        just why?
        
        I have a feeling BlueFS is going to assign me to code the physics for the E175 
        and for the other aircraft we are working on. It's going to be fun-->


            <!--User Guides aren't easy to code.
                why did I take responsibllity to do alot of things. like coding, 3D modeling-->


        <!--Whoever sees these commnets, It's called "there's bugs and I've been trying to figure out why 
            VS Code isn't dectecting it in the code. It took me so long to find each bug and how to solve
            them, even searched on youtube and that's not helpful. "-->
